# Zap templates

Zap templates are pre-made Zaps that help users discover popular use cases for automating their work. Each template features a specific use case and the apps (including yours!) needed for it to work.

## Prerequisites 

- Your app has passed the review process and is Published in the Zapier App Directory
- Your created [Zap templates](https://platform.zapier.com/publish/zap-templates) have been reviewed and made public 

## 1. Generate embedding code

Open the [Zap Templates generator](https://zapier.com/partner/solutions/plug-and-play) and type in your app’s name. 

Using the sidebar panel in the tool; change the theme, display Zap Templates based on app pairings and display (or exclude) popular apps and categories. When it’s ready, generate the correct code and add it anywhere on your site.
