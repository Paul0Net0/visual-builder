## Change scenario

If your APIâ€™s authentication method changes, you would need to change the method Zapier uses to authenticate user accounts.

## Impact to users

Changing the authentication type (e.g., Basic Auth, API Key, or OAuth) of an integration is regarded as a breaking change. Notably, migration is impracticable since all pre-existing connected accounts would stop working if migrated. Users would need to make a new connection to your integration and manually modify each of their Zaps.

However, if your integration meets the following conditions, you can use the [contact form](https://developer.zapier.com/contact) to request support for migrating connected accounts between authentication types:

1. Your integration is public.
2. You have an API endpoint or can otherwise programmatically exchange data of the old type (e.g. an API key) for the new type (e.g. an OAuth2 access and refresh token).
3. The API endpoints that the integration actions use, can work with both the old and new auth type, at least for a few months until the old type may be sunset.
4. Exchanging e.g. an API key for an OAuth2 access token doesn't immediately invalidate the API key, and thus break other connected accounts that may still use it.

## Best practices

**Creating a New Version**
- [Clone](https://platform.zapier.com/manage/clone) your app, generating a new version.
- [Remove](https://platform.zapier.com/build/auth#how-to-remove-or-change-zapier-integration-authentication-scheme) the existing authentication method and incorporate the new one.
- Once configured, [promote](https://platform.zapier.com/manage/promote) this version, making it available for new users to select during the connection of your integration to Zapier.

**Managing Existing Users**
- If users with existing authentications can retain their connection using the old method, enabling them to stick to the old version is recommended.
- However, they will be prompted to form a new connection for any new Zaps since only the promoted version is available during a name-based app search.


**Deprecating legacy authentication scheme**
- If existing authentications are set to be non-functional in the future, then [Deprecation](https://platform.zapier.com/manage/deprecate) is required.
- Be mindful that this can be notably disruptive for our mutual users and thus should be considered carefully.

>NOTE: this method is not possible with apps built in the legacy web builder. To update the authentication, you would need to update all triggers/actions/searches as well; as deleting the authentication method and re-adding it in the new builder would not be compatible with existing triggers/actions/searches built in the legacy web builder.
