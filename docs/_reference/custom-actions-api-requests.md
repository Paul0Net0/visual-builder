# Custom Actions and API Requests Actions

## What are Custom Actions and API Requests?

[Custom Actions](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/16276574838925-App-Extensions-in-Zapier) and [API Requests](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/12899607716493-Set-up-an-API-request-action#prerequisites-0-0) are features that have been developed internally at Zapier, designed to help our mutual customers achieve the most value out of your app integration. Custom Actions and API Requests enable Zapier users to build raw API requests with public APIs while leveraging your app integration's existing authentication protocol.

Since the launch, we’ve seen that the feature has been embraced and users are increasingly building and testing Custom Actions and API Requests. As customers build these requests, they may experience certain challenges with them – issues related to client permissions, malformed API URLs, or bad requests, for instance. These challenges, however, are neither unique nor unexpected, as they occur consistently in other similar settings like Zapier's built-in [Webhooks functionality](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/sections/16074864820109-Webhooks-Code).

The Zapier support team stands ready to help users understand the feature and ensure it works as anticipated. However, it is essential for the user to correct and resolve the API error themselves, which is analogous to Zapier's support policy for Webhooks. This empowers users to receive the best experience from the platform while strengthening their skills.

## Can I enable Custom Actions and API Requests for my integration if it's not currently enabled?

As of July 1, 2024, we are not supporting Custom Actions or API Requests for new integrations. However, we are committed to enhancing the experience for all users. If you are interested in enabling Custom Actions or API Requests for your integration, we encourage you to contact our Platform Support Team via our [contact form](https://developer.zapier.com/contact). Your feedback is invaluable and helps us understand the significance of this feature for our partners.

## Can I opt-out of Custom Actions and API Requests if it's already enabled?

We currently aren’t supporting an opt-out initiative. However, we are committed to bettering experiences for every user and encourage you to voice your concerns or feedback regarding this feature. Should you continue to experience any challenges or have specific pain points you’re encountering, we would be glad to work on those to improve your experience.

We understand that you may have apprehensions regarding the potential support load, especially with respect to users building their own API requests. Be assured, we are dedicated to helping alleviate any impacts that this may cause. The primary goal is to empower users with more control over their API requests, presenting them with a richer experience and a superior level of customization. We believe our users derive significant value from these direct API requests.

Do not hesitate to reach out with more questions and feedback via our [contact form](https://developer.zapier.com/contact). We are always open to dialogue aimed at improving our services and our working relationship with our partners.
