## Terms of Use

Zapier Partner Sandbox is a benefit of our Developer Program which Zapier may, in its sole discretion, choose to make available to select partners.

Sales Enablement/Demonstrations. Demonstrations of specific illustrative workflows that highlight the capabilities and benefits of your integration with Zapier. These demonstrations can be used as part of sales presentations or marketing materials to your prospective clients, but as mentioned below in (6), production data should not be run through any such workflows.
3. Zapier Partner Sandbox may only be used for the Purpose and not for any other purposes, including other commercial ones. If you need to use Zapier outside of the Purpose, including as a customer to create/develop automation workflows in support of your business (other than the demonstration ones referenced above), you must upgrade your personal account to a currently offered plan, which you may view at: http://zapier.com/pricing.
4. The Zapier Partner Sandbox workspace is owned and operated by Zapier, with access granted exclusively to qualifying users.
5. In the event that Zapier determines that an account is being used outside of the Purpose, Zapier reserves all rights, including being able to revoke access to Zapier Partner Sandbox.
6. Because Zapier Partner Sandbox may only be used for the Purpose, and the Zapier Partner Sandbox workspace is owned and operated by Zapier, you agree not to submit any production data through Zaps created within the Zapier Partner Sandbox workspace. You further agree that for program management purposes, the Zapier Partnerships team has access to Zaps created within the Zapier Partner Sandbox workspace and that you should not have the expectation of privacy that you would with a Zapier customer account.

Zapier may also update these Zapier Partner Sandbox terms at any time, and you can always find the most current version in our platform documentation.
8. The provisions of Section 3(e) (Beta Release) are incorporated by reference. In particular, Zapier is not and will not be liable for any Zaps or data that run through the Zapier Partner Sandbox workspace. Users acknowledge and assume full responsibility for their Zaps and any associated data stored in the Zapier Partner Sandbox workspace.
9. Zapier Partner Sandbox permits you to invite other users to the workspace. You may invite members of your integration team to the workspace (who will be asked to agree to these terms as well in order to maintain their access), but please do not add anyone who is not a member of your integration team.
